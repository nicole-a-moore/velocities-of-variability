GCMs are really large and can't be stored here easily. To use these scripts, download the GCM files by using batch scripts I wrote:
* First, create an account at [ESGF](https://esgf-node.llnl.gov/search/cmip5/)
* Then, replace instances of --username='XXX' --password='XXX' with your own username and password in [these batch scripts](https://github.com/nicole-a-moore/velocities-of-variability/tree/main/data-processed/wget_scripts)
* Run the modified batch scripts on your computer and the data should download

Figures created in these scripts live [here](https://github.com/nicole-a-moore/velocities-of-variability/tree/master/figures). 


Fun stuff:
* Look at my [shiny app](https://nicole-a-moore.shinyapps.io/vov-shiny/) to visualize the standardized climate models on my birthday!!!!
