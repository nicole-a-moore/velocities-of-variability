# velocities-of-variability

Unfortunately, GCMs are really large and can't be stored here easily. In order to use these scripts, first download the GCM files here:
  - [CMIP5 project data](https://esgf-node.llnl.gov/search/cmip5/)
      - You must create an account first to be able to access the GCM model output (top right corner)

Figures created in these scripts live [here](https://github.com/nicole-a-moore/velocities-of-variability/tree/master/figures).
